VirtualNascom, a Nascom II emulator/simulator version 1.0

This is a version 1.0, which although not finished is already very
useful (runs every program I've tried).

This is based on Yaze, and thus share it's copyright.  I should
improve the interface, but for now to run, use:

  ./xvirtualnascom [-m monitor.nal] [-v] [app.nal]

VirtualNascom expects to find `nassys.nal' (unless you changed that
with -m) and `basic.nal' upon startup.  You can add files to be loaded
by givin them as arguments at the end of the line.
