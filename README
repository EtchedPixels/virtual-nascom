VirtualNascom, a Nascom II emulator/simulator version 1.0

This is a version 1.0.1, which although not finished is already very
useful (runs every program I've tried).

A very crucial part of VirtualNascom is the excellent z80 emulator
from Yaze, which is also copylefted.


INSTALLATION

VirtualNascom should run under all resonable Unicies with X11 support.
To compile you may have to adapt the Makefile with the libraries you
need and their path.

VirtualNascom has been tested under Solaris 2.6/SPARC and Redhat ?/ix86.


USAGE

I should improve the interface, but for now to run, use:

  ./xvirtualnascom [-m monitor.nal] [-v] [app.nal]

VirtualNascom expects to find `nassys.nal' (unless you changed the
monitor using the `-m' option) and `basic.nal' upon startup.  You can
add files to be loaded by providing them as arguments at the end of
the line.
