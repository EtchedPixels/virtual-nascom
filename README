              A Nascom II emulator/simulator

                             Version 2.0

This is a version 2.0, which although not finished is already very
useful (runs every program I've tried).

A very crucial part of Virtual Nascom is the excellent Z80 emulator
from Yaze, which is also copylefted.


INSTALLATION

Virtual Nascom should compile on all platform with SDL support, but
has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.5.7 and Open SUSE 11.1/AMD64.

To compile you may have to adapt the Makefile with the libraries you
need and their path.


USAGE

I should improve the interface, but for now to run, use:

  ./virtualnascom [-m monitor.nal] [-v] [app.nal]

VirtualNascom expects to find `nassys.nal' (unless you changed the
monitor using the `-m' option) and `basic.nal' upon startup.  You can
add files to be loaded by providing them as arguments at the end of
the line.
