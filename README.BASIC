What follows is list of the tokens recognized by the Nascom
Microsoft Basic:

  * + - ^ / < = > ABS AND ASC ATN CHR$ CLEAR CLOAD CLS CONT COS CSAVE
  DATA DEEK DEF DIM DOKE END EXP FN FOR FRE GOSUB GOTO IF INP INPUT
  INT LEFT$ LEN LET LINES LIST LOG MID$ MONITOR NEW NEXT NOT NULL ON
  OR OUT PEEK POINT POKE POS PRINT READ REM RESET RESTORE RETURN
  RIGHT$ RND RUN SCREEN SET SGN SIN SPC( SQR STEP STOP STR$ TAB( TAN
  THEN TO USR VAL WAIT WIDTH

These are extracted directly from the binary image, so this list
should be complete (yes, SPC and TAB do have the opening parenthesis).
